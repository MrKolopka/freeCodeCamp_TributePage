      Garfield is an orange, fuzzy tabby cat born in the kitchen of an Italian restaurant who immediately ate all the pasta and lasagna in sight, 
      thus developing his love and obsession for lasagna and pizza.

  <p>
    Because of his appetite, the owner of Mamma Leoni's had to choose between keeping Garfield or closing down his restaurant; so Garfield was sold to a pet shop. 
    Garfield was adopted from the store by Jon Arbuckle on June 19, 1978. In his cartoon appearances, Garfield usually causes mischief in every episode. 
    In June 1983, comic strips introduced Amoeba Man, one of Garfield's alter-egos, yet he was only shown in six strips (June 20â€“25). 
    In February 2010, another alter ego was introduced called Super Garfield, and his sidekick Odieboy (Odie). 
    Amoeba Man and Super Garfield are only two of his few imaginary alter egos though, his most common one being the Caped Avenger. 
    Also for a very short period of time in 2001â€“02, Garfield would fall prey to an overweight dog assuming various identities 
    (e.g. Bungee Dog, Trapdoor Dog, Warm-Up Dog, etc.), which would appear from out of nowhere and squish him in any direction.

    Garfield is an overweight anthropomorphic orange tabby noted for his laziness, smug sarcasm, and intense passion for food, particularly lasagna, pizza, and ice cream.  
    Throughout the course of the strip, Garfield's weight is often an object of ridicule, particularly by his talking electronic scale. 
    Garfield usually does not handle insults or commands from the scale (or anybody else) very well, and will normally respond to such remarks with violence or a comeback 
    of some type.

    Garfield lives with his slightly eccentric, socially awkward owner Jon Arbuckle and Jon's dimwitted pet dog Odie, and derives pleasure from satirically teasing their 
    idiotic behavior. Garfield is not particularly fond of Odie (as obviously expected from the common hatred shared by cats and dogs) and enjoys causing him physical harm 
    or insulting him, seldom showing empathy for the beagle. Albeit Odie shows Garfield no belligerence of any kind and would never deliberately cause him harm, Garfield 
    dislikes him regardless and is apt to make rude comments based on the utter lack of intelligence displayed by Odie. However, Odie is not the only target of Garfield's 
    torments; he frequently pokes fun at Jon as well for his nerdy behaviors and unpopularity with women, along with his tacky, ridiculous fashion sense. Despite this, 
    Garfield cares for Odie and Jon regardless, but he especially shows affection for his beloved teddy bear Pooky, which is frequently seen in his arms or close to its 
    owner.

    As it have been described, Garfield actually likes many things and lets say there is the same number of things what he does not like whatsoever.
    Some of them you can find below. (most of them are obvious , if you are a cat lover ðŸ˜º).
